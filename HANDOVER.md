# Session Handover Document
Generated: 2025-09-13

## 🎯 Session Summary
This session appears to have focused on cleanup and preparation work for the q-status project, removing outdated documentation and demo files while updating distribution scripts.

## 📊 Current State

### Git Status
- **Branch**: master
- **Modified Files**: 
  - README.md (updated)
  - q-status-menubar/DISTRIBUTION.md
  - q-status-menubar/Makefile  
  - q-status-menubar/install.sh
- **Deleted Files** (not yet staged):
  - memory/constitution.md
  - memory/constitution_update_checklist.md
  - q-status-cli demo files (demo_output.txt, tui_simulation.sh, upgraded_demo.txt)
- **New Untracked**:
  - HOMEBREW_SETUP.md
  - homebrew/ directory

### Work Completed
Based on the changes:
1. ✅ Removed outdated documentation from memory/ directory
2. ✅ Cleaned up demo/test files from q-status-cli
3. ✅ Updated distribution and installation scripts for q-status-menubar
4. ✅ Started work on Homebrew setup (new files created but not committed)

## 🚧 In Progress / Needs Attention

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Review and stage changes**: All modifications need review before committing
2. **Homebrew setup**: New HOMEBREW_SETUP.md and homebrew/ directory appear to be work in progress
3. **Commit decision**: Decide whether to commit all changes together or separately

### Suggested Next Steps
```bash
# 1. Review the specific changes
git diff ../README.md
git diff DISTRIBUTION.md Makefile install.sh

# 2. Check what's in the new homebrew directory
ls -la ../homebrew/
cat ../HOMEBREW_SETUP.md

# 3. Stage and commit logically grouped changes
# Option A: Commit cleanup separately from new features
git add ../memory/ ../q-status-cli/  # Stage deletions
git commit -m "refactor: remove outdated documentation and demo files"

git add DISTRIBUTION.md Makefile install.sh
git commit -m "fix: update distribution and installation scripts"

# Option B: Review Homebrew setup and decide if ready
# If ready, add and commit; if not, continue development
```

## 📝 Context for Next Session

### Project Structure
- **q-status-menubar**: macOS menubar application (main focus)
- **q-status-cli**: Command-line interface (appears to have had demos removed)
- Distribution being prepared with updated Makefile and install scripts

### Likely Goals
Based on the changes pattern:
1. Setting up Homebrew distribution for easier installation
2. Cleaning up project structure for public release
3. Standardizing build and distribution processes

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- No commits have been made yet - all changes are uncommitted
- The homebrew/ directory and HOMEBREW_SETUP.md are new and unexplored
- Consider whether deletions were intentional before staging

## 🔄 Resume Commands
```bash
# To continue where left off
cd /Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/qlips/q-status-menubar

# Check status
git status

# Review pending changes
git diff --stat

# Continue with Homebrew setup
cat ../HOMEBREW_SETUP.md
```
