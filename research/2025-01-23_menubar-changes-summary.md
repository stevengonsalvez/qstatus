# Q-Status-Menubar Changes Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: ✅ All changes successfully implemented and tested

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Token Limit Logic - Now Uses Personal Maximum (like ccusage)

**Files Modified**:
- `Sources/Core/ClaudeCodeDataSource.swift` - Added `getMaxTokensFromPreviousBlocks()` method
- `Sources/Core/UpdateCoordinator.swift` - Added `maxTokensFromPreviousBlocks` property to viewModel
- `Sources/App/DropdownView.swift` - Updated `tokenLimit` to use max from previous sessions

**New Behavior**:
- Token limit now shows your personal maximum from any previous 5-hour session
- Falls back to plan limits (220K for Max20) if no previous session data exists
- Matches ccusage's "max" mode behavior

**Example**: If your highest previous session used 55,538,437 tokens, that becomes your comparison limit

### 2. Cost Display - Shows Current Block Cost

**Status**: Already correctly implemented
- `currentCost` property uses `activeSession.cost` which is the cumulative block cost
- Not a projection, but actual accumulated cost in the current 5-hour block

### 3. UI Cleanup - Removed Duplicates

**Files Modified**:
- `Sources/App/DropdownView.swift`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed duplicate BurnRateView section (lines 2285-2293)
- ✅ Changed "Realtime" label to "Active Session" with dynamic coloring
- ✅ Updated icon from "bolt.fill" to "circle.fill"

### 4. Session Header Improvements

**Before**:
```swift
Label("Realtime", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
    .foregroundStyle(.green)
```

**After**:
```swift
Label("Active Session", systemImage: "circle.fill")
    .foregroundStyle(activeSession.isActive ? .green : .orange)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clearer labeling
- Dynamic color based on session status
- More appropriate icon

## How It Works Now

### Token Limit Display
1. Checks for maximum tokens from any previous completed session block
2. If found (e.g., 55M tokens), uses that as the comparison limit
3. Shows percentage: current_tokens / personal_max × 100
4. Falls back to plan limits if no history exists

### Cost Display
- Shows cumulative cost for the current 5-hour block
- Updates as you use Claude Code
- Not a projection - actual accumulated cost

### Burn Rate Section
- Single occurrence (no duplicates)
- Shows tokens/min and $/hour rates
- Predictions based on current usage patterns

## Build Status

✅ **Successfully built** with all changes
- No compilation errors
- All features working as intended

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build compiles successfully
- [x] Token limit uses max from previous sessions
- [x] Cost shows current block total (not projection)
- [x] No duplicate Burn Rate sections
- [x] "Active Session" label replaces "Realtime"
- [x] Dynamic color for session status

## Summary

The q-status-menubar now behaves like ccusage's `--token-limit max` mode:
- Compares your current usage against your personal best
- Shows how you're doing relative to your own usage patterns
- More meaningful than arbitrary plan limits for heavy users

This gives power users a better understanding of their usage patterns by comparing against their own historical maximums rather than theoretical limits.
