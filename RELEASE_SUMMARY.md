```

### 2. Push Code and Tags

# Push master branch
git push -u origin master

# Push the release tag
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 3. Create GitHub Release
```bash
# From q-status-menubar directory
./create-github-release.sh
```

Or manually:
1. Go to https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qstatus/releases

### 4. Set Up Homebrew Distribution (Optional)
After creating the GitHub release:
1. Update the URLs in `homebrew/qstatus-cli.rb` and `homebrew/qstatus-menu.rb`
2. Calculate SHA256 for each file:
   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 releases/qstatus-cli-macos.tar.gz
   shasum -a 256 releases/QStatus.dmg
   ```
3. Update the SHA values in the formula files
4. Create a homebrew tap repository or submit to homebrew-core
